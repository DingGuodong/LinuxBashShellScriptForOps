    Ask user a yes/no question and return their response as True or False.

    :parameter question:
    ``question`` should be a simple, grammatically complete question such as
    "Do you wish to continue?", and will have a string similar to " [Y/n] "
    appended automatically. This function will *not* append a question mark for
    you.
    The prompt string, if given,is printed without a trailing newline before reading.

    :parameter default:
    By default, when the user presses Enter without typing anything, "yes" is
    assumed. This can be changed by specifying ``default=False``.
